      subheader: "DeterLab ISI is a web-accessed laboratory of choice for cybersecurity experimenters in research and
      education that provides tools for conducting scientific-based cyber experiments by use of its subsystems and
      hardware – DeterCore – to simulate networks at large scale and high fidelity with cyber physical and human
      agent behavior capabilities to create real-world proving grounds for experiment testing, re-use, sharing,
      and modification amongst the DETER user community."

          Originating in 2003 and funded by the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and the
          National Science Foundation, the DETER Project was formed to create experimental methodologies to enable
          innovations in cybersecurity research. The need for infrastructure to implement these methodologies gave 
          rise to DeterLab in 2004 – a state-of-the-art testbed – to experiment and test defense solutions for network
          technologies. For over a decade, DETER has supported thousands of researchers in academia, industry, and
          government. DeterLab's mission is to be THE lab and lab instance of choice, running on DeterCore, for cyber
          experimenters to use in advancing their research into realized cyber solution technologies to protect
          Internet-accessed information and Internet-connected smart devices that we rely upon for everyday wellbeing
          and prosperity.

           Since 2003, with funding from NSF, DHS, and DARPA, DeterLab has grown into a facility where hundreds of researchers 
           have conducted network and cybersecurity experimentation. The DeterLab User Community has hundreds of research 
           projects that have run myriad experiments, including published scientific papers of their results. The ability for 
           hands-on training of the next cybersecurity generation is also a key benefit of DeterLab in Education. Thousands of 
           students from institutions across the globe have experienced firsthand the advantage of learning with DeterLab’s 
           educational packaged materials and exercises taught by their instructors.

            DeterLab's core of capabilities provides the following advantages to its users:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Multi-Resolution Virtualization</b> of experiment resources.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Experiment Orchestration</b>, providing deterministic control over the various components in an experiment.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Federation</b> to connect heterogeneous resources from different owners with varying usage and access policies.
