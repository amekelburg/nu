        <p>
          DeterLab (cyber DEfense Technology Experimental Research Laboratory) is a state-of-the-art scientific 
          computing facility for cybersecurity researchers engaged in research, development, discovery, experimentation, 
          and testing of innovative cybersecurity technology. DeterLab is a shared testbed providing a platform for 
          research in cybersecurity and serving a broad user community, including academia, industry, and government. 
          To date, DeterLab-based projects have included behavior analysis and defensive technologies comprising DDoS 
          attacks, worm and botnet attacks, encryption, pattern detection, and intrusion-tolerant storage protocols.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2003, with funding from NSF, DHS, and DARPA, DeterLab has grown into a facility where hundreds of researchers 
          have conducted network and cybersecurity experimentation. The DeterLab User Community has hundreds of research 
          projects that have run myriad experiments, including published scientific papers of their results. The ability for 
          hands-on training of the next cybersecurity generation is also a key benefit of DeterLab. Thousands of students from 
          institutions across the globe have experienced firsthand the advantage of learning with DeterLab’s educational 
          packaged materials and exercises.

        <p>
          The DeterLab Core provides users with capabilities that are crucial in experimentation emulation, that includes:

            - <b>Multi-Resolution Virtualization<b> of experiment resources.
            - <b>Risky Experiment Management<b> to allow controlled experiment interaction with the real Internet.
            - <b>Experiment Orchestration<b>, providing deterministic control over the various components in an experiment.
            - <b>Federation<b> to connect heterogeneous resources from different owners with varying usage and access policies.
            - <b>Multi-Party Experiments Technology<b> that provides controlled but co-joined experiments, creating different views of the experiment environment for multiple experimenters or groups of experimenters within one unified experiment.
            - <b>Predictive Modeling of Human Behavior<b> supporting definition of mental models, reactive goal-driven behavior, and combinations of deliberative/instinctive behaviors.
        </p>

        <p>
          DeterLab supports:
        </p>

        <p>
            - Sharing of testbed resources among multiple concurrent experiments.
            - A growing library of tools, interfaces, and datasets for security experiments.
            - Nascent community building to enhance the scientific value of the work.

          Since 2003, with funding from NSF, DHS, and DARPA, DeterLab has grown into a facility where hundreds of researchers 
          have conducted network and cyber-security experimentation. The DeterLab User Communtiy has hundreds of research 
          projects that have run myriad experiments, to include publishing scientific papers of their results. More than 3800 students,
          the crucial next cyber-security generation, have received hands-on training via DeterLab. At the same time, 
          DeterLab has expanded in scale and power, as the DETER Project team has added both new computing resources, 
          and a variety of new scientific capabilities as a result of DETER’s research efforts.
