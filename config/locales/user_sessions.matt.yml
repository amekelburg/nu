          DeterLab: Advanced testbed facility where leading researchers and academics conduct critical cybersecurity 
          experimentation and educational exercises. It emulates real-world complexity and scale necessary to evolve 
          next generation solutions to help protect against sophisticated cyber attacks and network design vulnerabilities. 
          As devices become Internet integrated, the need for resilient design is apparent. This is where it begins.

            In order to use DeterLab and its tools you must first register for an account. This is accomplished 
            by an online application process. We ask for information that you would likely expect on most 
            types of applications, specific to evaluating access to a system and its collecitve resources. For example, you
            will need to provide a project purpose narrative if creating a project. You will also need to give us your 
            organization-affiliated email address for general communication and project approval notification 'next-steps' 
            from DETER Staff. <i>NOTE: Non organization-affiliated email addresses, such as gmail or those
            provided by an ISP, are not acceptable and will likely cause your application to be rejected.</i>

           Since 2003, with funding from NSF, DHS, and DARPA, DeterLab has grown into a facility where hundreds of researchers 
           have conducted network and cybersecurity experimentation. The DeterLab User Community has hundreds of research 
           projects that have run myriad experiments, including published scientific papers of their results. The ability for 
           hands-on training of the next cybersecurity generation is also a key benefit of DeterLab in Education. Thousands of 
           students from institutions across the globe have experienced firsthand the advantage of learning with DeterLab’s 
           educational packaged materials and exercises taught by their instructors.

          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Multi-Resolution Virtualization</b> of experiment resources.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Risky Experiment Management</b> to allow controlled experiment interaction with the real Internet.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Experiment Orchestration</b>, providing deterministic control over the various components in an experiment.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Federation</b> to connect heterogeneous resources from different owners with varying usage and access policies.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Multi-Party Experiments Technology</b> that provides controlled but co-joined experiments, creating different views of the experiment environment for multiple experimenters or groups of experimenters within one unified experiment.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            – <b>Predictive Modeling of Human Behavior</b> supporting definition of mental models, reactive goal-driven behavior, and combinations of deliberative/instinctive behaviors.
