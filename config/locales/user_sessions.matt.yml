          DeterLab (cyber DEfense Technology Experimental Research Laboratory) is a state-of-the-art scientific 
          computing facility for cybersecurity researchers engaged in research, development, discovery, experimentation, 
          and testing of innovative cybersecurity technology. DeterLab is a shared testbed providing a platform for 
          research in cybersecurity and serving a broad user community, including academia, industry, and government. 
          To date, DeterLab-based projects have included behavior analysis and defensive technologies comprising DDoS 
          attacks, worm and botnet attacks, encryption, pattern detection, and intrusion-tolerant storage protocols.

            In order to use DeterLab, its resources, and tools you must first register for an account. This is accomplished 
            by an online application process. There are two types of application forms: 
            
            <ol>
            1) New Project Application Form for project leaders to create a DeterLab project
            </ol>
            
            <ol>
            2) Apply For Project Membership Form to join an existing DeterLab project as a member
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            Both DeterLab forms ask for basic applicant information that you would expect to find on most types of application
            forms. For a New Project, we ask that you provide a purpose narrative for your proposed project. 
            You will also need to give us your organization-affiliated email address for general communication and project
            approval next steps from DETER Staff. <i>NOTE: Non organization-affiliated email addresses, such as gmail or those
            provided by an ISP, are not accepted and could cause immediate rejection of your application.</i>

           Since 2003, with funding from NSF, DHS, and DARPA, DeterLab has grown into a facility where hundreds of researchers 
           have conducted network and cybersecurity experimentation. The DeterLab User Community has hundreds of research 
           projects that have run myriad experiments, including published scientific papers of their results. The ability for 
           hands-on training of the next cybersecurity generation is also a key benefit of DeterLab in Education. Thousands of 
           students from institutions across the globe have experienced firsthand the advantage of learning with DeterLabâ€™s 
           educational packaged materials and exercises, from their instructors.

          <p>
            DeterLab's set of core capabilities, DETER Core, provides the following advantages to its User Community:

            - <b>Multi-Resolution Virtualization<b> of experiment resources.
            - <b>Risky Experiment Management<b> to allow controlled experiment interaction with the real Internet.
            - <b>Experiment Orchestration<b>, providing deterministic control over the various components in an experiment.
            - <b>Federation<b> to connect heterogeneous resources from different owners with varying usage and access policies.
            - <b>Multi-Party Experiments Technology<b> that provides controlled but co-joined experiments, creating different views of the experiment environment for multiple experimenters or groups of experimenters within one unified experiment.
            - <b>Predictive Modeling of Human Behavior<b> supporting definition of mental models, reactive goal-driven behavior, and combinations of deliberative/instinctive behaviors.
