      <h2>First Step to Getting DeterLab Access</h2>

      <p>
        You are on the initial page of the <b>Nu Registration Walk-Thru</b> for DeterLab access. This is where you need to be if you now have an adequate understanding of DeterLab basics, its usage policy, and who can apply. This also means that either your new project that you are applying for aligns with the appropriate use of DeterLab and/or that you know what type of access that you need/are qualified for.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start using DeterLab, a user account is required. We will walk you through the steps upon acknowledging that you have reviewed <i>Registering To Use DeterLab</i> and the <i>Usage Policy</i>, and then you will be allowed to click the "next" button to advance to the next page. <i>When applying, you must provide an organization-affiliated email address, meaning that it corresponds to the affiliation that you list in the application. A generic ISP email address, such as gmail or yahoo, will cause your application to reject.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>If you already have a DeterLab account/active project, please do not proceed with this walk-thru.</b> Instead, <a href="/#loginB">login here</a> and then choose from the options for requesting additional access.
